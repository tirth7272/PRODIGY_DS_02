# PRODIGY_DS_02
This notebook focused on a dataset related to customer transactions. We began by importing and cleaning the data to address missing values and anomalies. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize key variables such as transaction amounts and customer demographics. The dataset was split into training and testing sets to prepare for machine learning tasks, like fraud detection or customer segmentation. For visualization, we used histograms to display the distribution of transaction amounts and scatter plots to explore relationships between variables like age and transaction frequency.
